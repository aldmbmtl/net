def connect(tag=None):
    """
    Registers a function as a connection. This will be tagged and registered
    with the Peer server. The tag is a base64 encoded path to the function or
    can be manually tagged with the tag parameter. Tagging a named function
    allows you to interconnect functions between code bases.

    For example, a connected function with no tag is tied to the
    ``func.__module__`` + ``func.__name__``. This means the peers will only know
    which functions are compatible based on the namespace staying the same.

    .. code-block:: python

        # app version 1 running on PeerA
        app/
          module/
            function

        # app version 2 running on PeerB
        app/
          module/
            function2 <- # renamed from function

    In the above example, PeerA could make a request to PeerB to execute
    "app.module.function". But that function no longer exists as far as PeerB is
    concerned. The source code and functionality could be exactly the same, but
    the logical location is different and therefore will fail.

    .. code-block:: python

        # app version 1 running on PeerA
        app/
          module/
            function (tagged: "MyTaggedFunction")

        # app version 2 running on PeerB
        app/
          module/
            function2 (tagged: "MyTaggedFunction")

    In the above example, we have tagged function and function2 with the same
    tag, "MyTaggedFunction". Now when PeerA requests to execute, it will request
    that PeerB executes "MyTaggedFunction" which is attached to the new renamed
    function.

    Standard no tagging
